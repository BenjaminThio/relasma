It can also be used in a self-deprecating manner to express embarrassment or, due to the person's positioning, convey exhaustion. In some cultures and religious contexts, this emoji may also be used as a sign of prayer or worship. Earlier designs led some users to misinterpret this emoji as showing a person doing push-ups, lying down for a massage, or doing a cute \"head resting on hands\" gesture. While it may be used in these ways infrequently, its most common meanings are those of apology and respect.",

Shown with a headboard at the left and footboard with a person under the covers, head on the pillow. Most platforms suggest a wooden frame and feature blue or red sheets. The appearance of the person varies. Apple and Facebook's designs show only the hair of the sleeper, Apple's black and Facebook's brown and tousled. Other major vendors show the head of the sleeper in default yellow with short, brown or blonde hair. Skin tone support is not recommended for this emoji, though it is supported on some platforms . Vendors implement the same style of bed as for their 🛏️ Bed , but with a sleeper in it.",

Pinched Fingers has a variety of other culturally specific uses. In Israeli culture it can mean “hold on,” “relax,” or “be patient.” The K-Pop star Yuri uses it as a signature gesture to represent a dumpling and a general warm sentiment. It can also be used to represent the act of fisting . Not to be confused with 🤏 Pinching Hand , which has overlapping senses. Both are used to represent precision when someone is making a sharp point with accompanying speech.",

May also be used as a form of ✨emphasis✨ or to convey sarcastic or mocking tones . As of late 2023, an icon similar to the sparkles emoji is also often used within tech platforms to represent a feature that utilizes artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Twitter’s sparkles were previously multicolored, while Samsung’s sparkles were previously depicted on a night sky, suggesting firework sparklers . Twitter's mobile app uses ✨ Sparkles as a button users can tap to toggle between latest and top tweets on their timeline. Similar emojis with less implied meaning include ⭐ Star , 🌟 Glowing Star , and 💫 Dizzy . This emoji predates emojis inclusion within Unicode . The earliest incarnation of this emoji could be found in Japanese emoji keyboards in 1999 , specifically within the Docomo emoji set designed by Shigetaka Kurita.",

This emoji goes back to the late 1990s when it was included in Docomo's emoji set . In 2009, it appeared on a proposal as one of many symbols available on Japanese phones recommended to be encoded into the Unicode Standard. In that proposal, the symbol was referred to as a \"recreational vehicle\" or RV. The original Japanese emojis look more like station wagons or SUVs than RVs. At various points, platforms including Google and Samsung showed this emoji as an RV, but ultimately the designs across platforms converged to a car that looks more like an SUV or station wagon.
